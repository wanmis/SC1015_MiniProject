Background Info:
Airbnb has become an increasingly popular choice for travelers around the world
It can be challenging to determine the optimal price for a listing, especially given the many variables at play.
Price of a listing is determined by a number of factors, such as the property's location, the amenities provided, and even the time of year. 
Moreover, these factors interact with each other in complex ways, making it difficult to predict the best price for a listing.

Problem Definition:
Can we predict the rental price of a listing with its attributes?
Which model among the ones we selected would be the best to predict it?

Model Used:
  Linear Regression
  K-Nearest Neighbours
  Random Forest Regression
  XGBoost
Among the models used, Random Forest Regression works best.
