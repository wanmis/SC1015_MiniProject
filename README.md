## Background Info:
Airbnb has become an increasingly popular choice for travelers around the world
It can be challenging to determine the optimal price for a listing, especially given the many variables at play.
Price of a listing is determined by a number of factors, such as the property's location, the amenities provided, and even the time of year. 
Moreover, these factors interact with each other in complex ways, making it difficult to predict the best price for a listing.
